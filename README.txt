Cosine Wave Distortion

=====================================
This program tests the functionality of a cosine-wave distorter, and
outputs the outcome of this function to a text file
named "cosine-d.txt"

-------------------------------------
I use this function for random dithering of pixels,
or of whole tile coloring for an aesthetic.
